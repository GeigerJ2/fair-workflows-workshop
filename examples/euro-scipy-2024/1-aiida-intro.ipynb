    "### More on provenance\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ORM entry point in AiiDA is the **Node** class, which provides the functionalities to interact with the\n",

    "  data**, but only **return already existing data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction allows for a the conceptual separation of the **data provenance** and **logical provenance**. In the\n",
    "former case, due to the causality principle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) must result, while in the second case, as a\n",
    "workflow can **return** its inputs, cycles can be present in the graph.\n",

    "The interested reader is referred to the [relevant documentation section on\n",

    "external tool that we will cover in this workshop enters: [**`aiida-shell`**](https://aiida-shell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the `CalcJob` interface for an external code requires significant Python and AiiDA expertise, and is typically a\n",
    "task taken care of by an AiiDA plugin developer. The [AiiDA plugin\n",
    "registry](https://aiidateam.github.io/aiida-registry/) currently contains almost 100 plugins with 163 `CalcJob`s\n",

    "\n",
    "Further, to define a workflow in AiiDA, the typical approach is to construct a `WorkChain` by inheriting from the\n",
    "`WorkChain` class, like so: `class EuroSciPyWorkChain(WorkChain):`. However, constructing this class correctly again\n",
    "requires advanced Python and AiiDA expertise, so to simplify the generation of workflows, the [**`aiida-workgraph`**](https://aiida-workgraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/search.html)\n",

    "Finally, we should mention that `aiida-shell` and `aiida-workgraph` are currently not part of the `aiida-core`\n",
